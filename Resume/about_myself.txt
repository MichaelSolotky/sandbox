I study ML and computer science at the Lomonosov Moscow State University at the Department of Mathematical Methods of forecasting. Now I'm finishing my internship in Yandex in voice technology department. I'm interested in solving various tasks of machine learning especially in NLP area and implementation of non-trivial optimal algorithms of data processing. I have experience of implementation of some parallel algorithms on a cluster using map reduce technology. Would also like to do some research activity including articles reading, performing computational experiments and hypothesis checking. I have some good level of intuition and knowledge in algebra, calculus, probability theory, statistics, discrete mathematics, mathematical optimization and other mathematical subjects.
