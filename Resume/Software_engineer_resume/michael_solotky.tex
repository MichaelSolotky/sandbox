% Global notes:
% 1. Font
% 1.a. Font size: I saw even smaller font in other resumes, so think about making it smaller
% 1.b. Italic font style: the TechLead suggests to not use italic, and I think that a few italic is not that bad
% 1.c. Bold font style: too much bold is not ok. In this resume now it's not too much, but just know about that
% 2. Dates are shifted to the right and it could be inconvenient to read it

%----------EDUCATION-END----------


%----------EXPERIENCE-BEGIN----------
% Notes:
% 1. Still not sure whether I should write what I was working on
% 1.a. Put more numbers and clear measurable achievements in this section (Alexandra Chudinova says it's a must for the US and Canada: https://youtu.be/7aZSO8v58rE?t=3699, https://youtu.be/7aZSO8v58rE?t=7047)
% 1.b. Sometimes people write what they were developing (projects)
% 1.c. Writing about your duties (e.g. writing integ tests) is excessive because it's obvious from the job title
% 2. Think about that mentioning irrelevant skills or writing too much about an irrelevant job position that you had could make it more difficult for a recruiter to decide whether to take you
% Sources:
% 2.1. The TechLead's video called "Ex-Googler Resume Tips for software engineers": (https://youtu.be/rCOgVQ8a1zs?t=137)
% 2.2. Segrey Nemchinski's video called with resume analysis (https://youtu.be/J8k5TCa3UYA?t=645)
% 2.3. Various people saying that it's bad to have one resume for all roles apparently suggesting that if you have multiple resumes you can remove irrelevant stuff from them
% 3. Looks like it's ok to have gaps between different work positions (from a video of Sergey Nemchinski and Alexandra Chudinova: https://youtu.be/7aZSO8v58rE?t=6001)
% 4. I believe that a short description of the projects would help to make a picture of what the person was doing (proofs: a Nemchinski's video https://youtu.be/jhnsjSCgtu0?t=1309, and I tried to read a resume sent by Yashasvi Singh and I understood that it's easier to read when you understand what the person was doing)
% 5. A Google recruiter asked me about my responsibilities and the current job, looks like they might be different in different companies
% 6. If there were many projects in a particular position it can be written like that "many various projects in X area" (the area should be mentioned), source: Nemchinski's video (https://youtu.be/jhnsjSCgtu0?t=4346)

% Notes:
% 1. Think about removing this section
% 1.1 Sergey Nemchinski in his video (https://youtu.be/2zps16PJA1k?t=707) had doubts about adding projects if a person already has 1 year of experience. Like it's not necessary, but also adds, so maybe not a problem. Most likely now it can be left, but you can remove this section when adding the next job

%----------SKILLS-BEGIN----------
% Notes:
% 1. Think about moving it above, even higher than the Experience section
% 1.1 I remember a recommendation from Google recruiters to put programming languages at the top and from Sergey Nemchinski to put all the skills at the top, followed by Experience and only then followed by Education
% 1.2. At the same time Clement Mihailescu also put the Skills at the bottom (although he was experienced by that time), source: "The Resume That Got Me Into Google (software engineer resume tips)" (https://youtu.be/aKjsy-b00QM?t=806)
% 1.3. At the same time the TechLead didn't summarize his skills at all in his resume, source: "7 Tips for the Coding Resume (for Software Engineers)" (https://youtu.be/xpaz7nrNmXA?t=587)
% 2. Think about removing some irrelevant skills (or at least moving them to the ends of respective lines), see more in the notes to the Experience section
% 2.1. Idea: a person who knows everything actually doesn't know anything, took it from Sergey Nemchinski's video (https://youtu.be/mi0mRDIL_z8?t=7816)
% 3. Think about adding soft skills here: scrum, public speaking
% 3.1. Public speaking for example was proposed by Sergey Nemchinki (I don't remember the source), but also he said together with Alisa Yeremenko that one shouldn't list soft skills in a resume cos this is something recruiters find during an interview (source: https://youtu.be/-ghtEmXux5U?t=1118)
% 4. Maybe the "Technologies/Libraries" item can be split or merged with "Tools" as now the sub-items in those two items are really similar

\section{Skills}

% Note: the only reason why sub-items are used instead of items is that they provide good spacing out-of-the-box
